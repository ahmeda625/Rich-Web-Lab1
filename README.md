-----I decided to make the extension to change images to anime images instead of cats. I added a popup when the extension is used  with a text box.

-----I made an alert everytime you use the extension you get a sound alert and I did this by adding a service worker called worker_wrapper and that is is where I specified the script to make the alert sound in the background.

-----I added a feature to the popup that when you click a button it changes a h1 tag and this was a way to show I implemented and and modified the DOM Elements.
