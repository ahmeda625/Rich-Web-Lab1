-----I decided to make the extension to change images to anime images instead of cats. I added a popup when the extension is used  with a text box.

-----I made an alert everytime you use the extension you get a sound alert and I did this by adding a service worker called worker_wrapper and that is is where I specified the script to make the alert sound in the background.
